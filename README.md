# GPIO on the Raspberry Pi

This is a presentation that I did on November 30, 2016 for the Hamilton
Internet of Things Meetup.

In it, I present an introduction to GPIO and digital I/O on the Raspberry Pi
platform.  There are several circuits shown for input and output, including switches
LEDs and Relay drivers.

The presentation is done with 'reveal.js', a JavaScript-based presentation framework
(described in 'Reveal-README').  Short instructions on how to use this presentation:

- Clone this repository
- 'cd' into the repository
- 'npm install' to load all the npm modules
- 'npm start' to startup the web server
- Use a browser to load http://localhost:8000

Enjoy...
